## Inspiration :bulb:

Agriculture being the most important sector of Indian Economy, accounts for 18% of India's GDP.  Agriculture thus needs reforms to help the country grow.
Key Problems
- Nowadays, it is seen that farmers tend to bear a loss while purchasing seeds from the market which are damaged and costly as well. 
- The weather being an environmental factor poses a threat to the crops, in case of excess rains.
- The farmers need to be aware of when to water their crops and exactly how much watering does it need. 

## What it does? :gear:
Our solution includes :
- A platform where farmers can check weather forecasts,soil moisture and temperature and an integrated e-commerce website where farmers can purchase certified best quality seeds which enhances their crop production & reduces the losses .
- An IoT device through which farmers can check the current soil moisture and proceed the irrigation process accordingly.
 
## Our Unique Features ‚ú®

‚≠ê E-commerce website : Where a farmer can buy/sell quality & certified seeds.<br>
