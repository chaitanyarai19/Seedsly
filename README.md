## Inspiration :bulb:

Agriculture being the most important sector of Indian Economy, accounts for 18% of India's GDP.  Agriculture thus needs reforms to help the country grow.<br>
Key Problems
- Farmers often struggle with obtaining seeds that are of a consistent quality and are suitable for their specific growing conditions.
- They have lack of access to reliable, high-quality seeds and soil information .
- They often lack access to real-time weather and soil information that can greatly impact the success of their crops.


## What it does? :gear:
Our solution includes :
- A platform where farmers can check weather forecasts,soil moisture and temperature and an integrated e-commerce website where farmers can purchase certified best quality seeds which enhances their crop production & reduces the losses .
- An IoT device through which farmers can check the current soil moisture and proceed the irrigation process accordingly.
 
## Our Unique Features ‚ú®

‚≠ê E-commerce website : Where a farmer can buy/sell quality & certified seeds.<br>
‚≠ê An IoT device : It detects soil moisture content , which informs the farmer whether or not irrigation should be done , also the amount of irrigation to be done can be decided.<br>
‚≠ê Supply Chain : Verification at every stage of production and provide a certified check to ensure seeds quality.<br>
‚≠ê Live Weather forecasts : To let the farmers know about the appropriate seeds to be sowed according to the weather conditions at the moment.<br>
‚≠ê Instant Translation : To make our platform viable to all groups of people by eliminating the lingual barrier.<br>
