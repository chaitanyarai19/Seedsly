## Inspiration :bulb:

<b>Agriculture being the most important sector of Indian Economy, accounts for 18% of India's GDP.  Agriculture thus needs reforms to help the country grow.</b><br>
<b>Key Problems:-</b>
- Farmers often struggle with obtaining seeds that are of a consistent quality and are suitable for their specific growing conditions.
- They have lack of access to reliable, high-quality seeds and soil information .
- They often lack access to real-time weather and soil information that can greatly impact the success of their crops.


## What it does? :gear:
<b>Our solution includes :</b>
- A platform where farmers can check weather forecasts,soil moisture and temperature and an integrated e-commerce website where farmers can purchase certified best quality seeds which enhances their crop production & reduces the losses .
- An IoT device through which farmers can check the current soil moisture and proceed the irrigation process accordingly.
